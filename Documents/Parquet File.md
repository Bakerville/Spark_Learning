Parquet is an open source column-oriented data store that provides a variety of storage optimizations, especially for analytics workloads. It provides columnar compression, which saves storage space and allows for reading individual columns instead of entire files.

This format also offer schemas built into the files, that its operation is same as **<code>inferSchema</code>** when reading **.csv** file.
